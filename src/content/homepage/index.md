      content: Dear Wence and Team, I would like to take a moment to extend my gratitude to you and your team for walking with us as we transition from an analogue way of collecting and keeping our business records. Your point of sale system has changed the way we do business, we don't have a hip of paper work in the office and extracting data is now so easy! But above all, your patience and flexibility to work with the many changes we wanted is very appreciated. I will always recommend you with confidence!.
